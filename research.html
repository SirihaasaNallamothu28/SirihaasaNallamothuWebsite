          LeukosCognosis is a 98% accurate Supervised Concolutional Nueral Network that can diagnose Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in a matter of seconds. I built this convolutional neural network through Tensorflow/Keras and Python and hope to deploy this in the medical field. I am currently writing a research paper for this project. Please watch my youtube video for more details.
Every 9 minutes a person in the United States dies from Leukemia, or cancer of the blood and bone marrow. Essentially, Leukemia is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow and occurs when one’s body rapidly produces abnormal white blood cells, which decreases the body’s ability to fight infections. If Leukemia is not immediately diagnosed, as symptoms are often lucrative, this disease can act quickly. According to the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, diagnosis and lab blood smear sample tests can take weeks to return, decreasing a patient’s ability and chances to survive. The need for a quick, effective, and proper diagnosis tool is urgent. In an effort to solve this problem, I created LeukosCognosis. LeukosCognosis is a Machine Learning Algorithm that can diagnose Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia[ALL] on the spot with 97% accuracy. This algorithm can accurately diagnose Leukemia in seconds, a juxtaposition to the weeks that a lab Leukemia diagnosis may take. All the oncologist would have to do is take a microscopic image of the suspected white blood cell smear, and upload it to the model. Within seconds, the model will accurately diagnose the sample and predict the probability of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. LeukosCognosis is unique as it provides a one-stop solution to long and often inaccurate lab tests and can be performed almost immediately. Once this model is deployed in the medical field, it will save time, money, and lives.

RiscusExplorato: A Machine Learning Algorithm to help aid in the Diagnosis of Covid-19
May 2020 – Present

Project descriptionRiscusExplorato is a Machine Learning Algorithm to help aid the overall Diagnosis of Covid-19 via means of radiology and chest X-rays. The CDC has recognized extreme chest pain and shortness of breath as symptoms of coronavirus in this pandemic. These symptoms are often an indication of lung damage; using an X-ray can determine whether the patient is experiencing Viral Pneumonia, Covid-19 complications, or has Healthy lungs. Doctor's can Utilize RiscusExplorato’s classification to their advantage and use it as a factor in their diagnosis. All the radiologist has to do is take an image of the patient’s chest x-ray, upload it to the model, and receive a categorization or diagnosis. RiscusExplorato is essentially a Machine Learning algorithm that is 97% Accurate and can diagnose the Chest X-ray in a matter of seconds.
Convolutional Neural Networks are a form of machine learning and entails many layers and pixel data. A Convolutional Network takes in an input image, which is then pixelated and analyzed through the Convolutional Layer. The Convolutional Layer essentially finds notable features in the image to help with classification, including edges, curves, and shapes. The pixelated image then goes through the pooling layer, which involves max pooling. This means that the pixelated image is broken down into groups and thoroughly analyzed for key features. The Neurons in the Dense layer essentially filter the key features and get it ‘ready’ for the final categorization of the image. The output layer provides a yes or no answer to the classification.
RiscusExplorato will save time, money, and lives.
RiscusExplorato has won first place in the Covid19 Equal Engineers International Challenge.

      <label class="project"> Support System: An App for the Saftey of Women and Girls</label>   
        <div class= "projectbullet" style="width:1250px;">
          <p  class="stume">
            I created Support System as an 8th grader[2019].
A passage from my research paper:
Support System has 3 emergency screens. The first emergency screen is the general emergency screen. This screen can be used by anybody, even people who do not have an account with ​the Support System​. The general emergency screen benefits the user the most when they have an account. The screen can be used to access to a support hotline for suicide, depression, or rape, report sexual violence/assault, call or text an emergency contact (Only if you have an account), and even to text 9-1-1. This screen can also be used to send your location and a picture of your surroundings to an emergency contact. The second emergency screen is for those who have an account with Support System​. This screen is a natural disaster screen. The Natural disaster screen can be usedif there is a first aid need, a hailstorm, winter storm, dust storm, a Red Cross need, and more. This screen is essential for any natural disaster needs a person may have. The last emergency screen that is featured in this app is the Personal Emergency screen. This screen is exclusively for women with ​Support System​ Accounts. The Personal Emergency screen can be used to send automated and customized texts to an emergency contact. The user can customize texts for different personal emergencies.
My app aims to improve the everyday lives of women and girls. After all, women everywhere need a ​Support System​.
